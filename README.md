# Old PersonalPortfolio

Worked on a personal portfolio to represent my skills and accomplishment as a Computer Science student.

Used HTLM, CSS, and JavaScript to make a function website to showcase my Resume, Projects, and include my contact information.

There should be an updated one posted with new information and better visuals. Keep an eye out!
